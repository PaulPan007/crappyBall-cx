# CRAPPY VERSION OF FLAPPY BIRD A.K.A CRAPPYBALL - WRITTEN IN CX

CrappyBall-cx is a clone to a popular game called FlappyBird and it is a simple 2D game written in cx. cx is a programming language developed by [Skycoin Team](https://www.skycoin.net/ "Skycoin"). Please note that I am not a developer for the Skycoin team but I do hold Skycoin through my own purchases. The game was developed as my interest to learn the CX language as well as to promote social awareness to Skycoin and their projects.

# TO DO...
Alot of things. The current codebase is utter crap and needs to be completely refractored. I am still in the process of learning the cx language... e.g

1. Figure how to load sprites
2. Refractor game into a more Entity-Component-System architecture
3. Use VAO/VBO for rendering instead of OpenGL primitives
